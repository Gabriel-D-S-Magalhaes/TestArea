    // For URLs which use the schema http, https, or no schema, the following restrictions and
    // interpretations apply:
    //
    //  * If no schema is provided, https is assumed.
    //
    //  * The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as
    //  in path/google.protobuf.Duration).
    //
    //  * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type value in binary format, or produce
    //  an error.
    //
    //  * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled
    //  into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on
    //  changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)

    // specific semantics.
